From the given data sets created 100 records of data sets with some modification (added options array),

stoared data sets in a js file then using Math.random() function sending a single city object in response,

Initially getting correct city in the first option index so again changed the data set with the help of AI tool,

while sending the response removing the city and country name from the responsre to hide answer from the user,

instead of that sending the reandom_index in which the city is stored,

accepting both random_index and user selected option in a payload to vaidate the answer,

creating the user with user_name and score, created an API to get the user score by recieving user_name in query string
